**Push_Swap**

Summary: Description
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

---
The rules:
1. You have 2 stacks named a and b.
2. The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers
which cannot be duplicated. The stack b is empty.
3. The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the
following operations at your disposal:
     - Swap: Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a, b or both.
     - Push: Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a or the other way around.
     - Rotate: Shift up all elements of stack a, b or both by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
     - Reverse rotate: Shift down all elements of stack a, b or both by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
